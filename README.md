* 
* ---
* 
* The "PALAEMON-RULES-ENGINE" microservice implements the Evacuation Messaging Policy of PaMEAS-A.
* An Evacuation Messaging Policy, is defined as a set of 
* requirements/principles that specify the instructions/actions to the passengers and crew of a 
* ship in an effort to perform an ordered and timely (semi-automated) evacuation.
* These instructions are disseminated to the entities in the form of easy to read 
* and comprehend messages during the various evacuation phases
* 
* An Evacuation Messaging Policy can be formalized as a set of Rules. 
* Each rule describes an operation or process requirement for an entity action and has two parts
* - One is the action, which specifies the operation 
* - The other one is the properties, that specify parameters of this operation  
* 
* These Rules can be combined into a RuleSet with logical connectives (and, or, xor, etc.) and one or more
* RuleSets form a Policy Object. Finally, the Evacuation Messaging Policy is defined as the 
* set of all such Policy Objects. 
* 
* 
* The PALAEMON-RULES-ENGINE maintains a Rules Engine (implemented over [Drools](https://www.drools.org/)) to contain and process the Rule-Based Evacuation 
* Messaging Policy of PaMEAS-A. This Rules Engine is made available to the rest of the PaMEAS-A microservices
* via a REST API to implement the required flows. Specifically, the PaMEAS Evacuation Policy is defined via four main family of rules:
* 
* - RF1: The first rule family consists of one ruleset and its purpose is to define the evacuation profile of the passengers based on their health data.
* - RF2: The second rule family consists of two rulesets and its purpose is to define the evacuation path the passengers must follow based on their location and the status of the evacuation routes.
* - RF3: The third rule family consists of one ruleset and its purpose is to compose the message objects of each evacuation task based on the evacuation phase and the emergency information that needs to be communicated under each task.
* - RF4: The fourth rule family consists of two rulesets and its purpose is to define the body of the message object (including any auxiliary files, e.g. picture of evacuation paths, etc.) to be sent during the evacuation phases of the ship to the passengers and crew:
*   - The first rule set defines the messages addressed to the crew.
*   - The second rule set defines the messages addressed to the passengers of the ship.

* # Code
* 
* ---
* 
* *Disclaimer: Although we tested the code extensively, the "PALAEMON-RULES-ENGINE" is a research
* prototype that may contain bugs. We take no responsibility for and give no warranties in respect of using the code.*
* 
* ## Layout
* 
* The "PALAEMON-RULES-ENGINE" microservice is implemented
* via a Spring boot application.  As a result it adheres to the typical Spring boot structure:
* - `src/main` contains the main logic of the application
* - `src/resources/rules` contains the .drl files defining the rules of the Evacuation Messaging Policy
* - `src/test` contains the executed unit tests
* 
* 
* # Deployment
* 
* ---
* The "PALAEMON-RULES-ENGINE" microservice is implemented via Spring Boot and is Dockerized in order to
* facilitate its deployment. As a result this microservice can be easily deployed using:
* ```
* docker run --name endimion13/palaemon-rules-engine:0.0.1n -p  8091:8080 -d 
* ```
* Additionally, a typical Docker-compose file for its deployment would look as follows:
* ```
*  
* version: '2'
* services:
*    palaemon-rules-engine:
*     image:  endimion13/palaemon-rules-engine:0.0.1n
*     environment:
*       - PATHS_CSV=/csvs/paths.csv
*     ports:
*       - 8091:8082
* ```
* 
* 
* # API
* 
* ---
* 
* The PALAEMON-RULES-ENGINE service exposes a protected REST API.
* For easier integration this API is defined using the OpenAPI notation.
* In order to gain access to a deployed instance API OpenAPI documentation navigate to
* `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/`
